# Sentiment Analysis Using Hugging Face Transformers and Streamlit
 This application classifies a user's input as POSITIVE or NEGATIVE based on the default Hugging Face Transformer model. The web app is built using Streamlit and can be deployed using Streamlit Sharing or via Heroku.
 
 For more information about how I created the app, check out my [**Medium post**](https://medium.com/@rtkilian/deploy-and-share-your-sentiment-analysis-app-using-streamlit-sharing-2ba3ca6a3ead).

*Note: it will take up to 30 seconds to run the app.*
